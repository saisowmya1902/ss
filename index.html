    <h1><mark>ABOUT FOOD</mark></h1>
    <p>Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support. Food is usually of plant, animal, or fungal origin and contains essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the needs of their metabolisms and have evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical contexts.</p>

    <p>"Junk food" is a term used to describe food that is high in calories from sugar and/or fat, and possibly sodium, making it hyperpalatable, but with little dietary fiber, protein, vitamins, minerals, or other important forms of nutritional value.<sup>[1][2][3]</sup> It is also known as HFSS food (high in fat, salt and sugar).<sup>[4] </sup>The term junk food is a pejorative dating back to the 1950s.<sup>[5] </sup>Many different kinds of junk food can be easily found in most supermarkets and fast food restaurants. Because of such easy access to it, people are most likely to consume it. <sup>[6]</sup></p><br>
